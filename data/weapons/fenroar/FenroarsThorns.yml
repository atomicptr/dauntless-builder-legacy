      On jumping, create a platform of stone in the air ahead of you that lasts for up to {{platformTime}} seconds.
      Up to {{numberJumps}} jumps in a row can be performed before ability must be recharged. Activating Lantern
      refreshes the {{numberJumps}} jumps. Shortly after forming, the platform falls, dealing {{fallDamage}} Terra
      damage, and interrupting behemoths.

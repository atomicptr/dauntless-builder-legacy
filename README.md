## Assets

All Dauntless related assets are the property of Phoenix Labs.

We're also using some icons from [Game Icons](https://game-icons.net/), such as:

* [Visored Helm](/assets/icons/general/Head.png)
* [Breastplate](/assets/icons/general/Torso.png)
* [Mailed Fist](/assets/icons/general/Arms.png)
* [Steeltoe Boots](/assets/icons/general/Legs.png)

The icons and the data are mostly from the [Dauntless Wiki](https://dauntless.gamepedia.com/Dauntless_Wiki), so huge thanks
to all who are working on it :).
